/*
 * Behavior for out-of-range values during writes to Iceberg data files.
 *
 * Applies to:
 *   - Temporal columns (date, timestamp, timestamptz): values beyond
 *     the Iceberg-supported range are clamped or rejected.
 *   - Bounded numeric columns: NaN values are clamped to NULL or rejected.
 *
 * Controlled by the out_of_range_values table option (default: clamp).
 *
 * CLAMP silently adjusts out-of-range values to the nearest representable
 * boundary (e.g. year 10000 becomes 9999-12-31, NaN becomes NULL).
 * ERROR raises an error instead.
 * NONE skips validation entirely (used for non-Iceberg tables).
